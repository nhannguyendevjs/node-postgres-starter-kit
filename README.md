```

## Coding Naming Conventions

➖ PascalCase 👉 Classes and Methods

➖ camelCase 👉 variable and function names

➖ snake_case 👉 file names and variable identifiers

➖ kebab-case 👉 HTML attributes and CSS classes

➖ UPPERCASE 👉 CONSTANTS and ENUMERATIONS

➖ UPPER_SNAKE_CASE 👉 CONSTANTS and ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES

## Git Branch Naming Convention

### Code Flow Branches

➖ Development (dev)

All new features and bug fixes should be brought to the development branch.

➖ QA/Test (test)

Contains all codes ready for QA testing.

➖ Staging (staging, Optional)

It contains tested features that the stakeholders wanted to be available either for a demo or a proposal before elevating into production.

➖ Master (master)

The production branch, if the repository is published, is the default branch being presented.

### Temporary Branches

#### ➖ Feature

Any code changes for a new module or use case should be done on a feature branch. This branch is created based on the current development branch. When all changes are Done, a Pull Request/Merge Request is needed to put all of these to the development branch.

Examples

feature/AZURE-1234

feature/AZURE-5678

#### ➖ Bug Fix

If the code changes made from the feature branch were rejected after a release, sprint or demo, any necessary fixes after that should be done on the bugfix branch.

Examples

bugfix/AZURE-1234

bugfix/AZURE-5678

#### ➖ Hot Fix

If there is a need to fix a blocker, do a temporary patch, or apply a critical framework or configuration change that should be handled immediately, it should be created as a Hotfix. It does not follow the scheduled integration of code and could be merged directly to the production branch and then into the development branch later.

Examples

hotfix/disable-endpoint-zero-day-exploit

hotfix/increase-scaling-threshold

#### ➖ Experimental

Any new feature or idea that is not part of a release or a sprint. A branch for playing around.

Examples

experimental/dark-theme-support

#### ➖ Build

A branch specifically for creating specific build artifacts or for doing code coverage runs.

Examples

build/azure-metric

#### ➖ Release

A branch for tagging a specific release version.

Examples

release/app-1.0.0

#### ➖ Merging

A temporary branch for resolving merge conflicts, usually between the latest development and a feature or Hotfix branch. This can also be used if two branches of a feature being worked on by multiple developers need to be merged, verified, and finalized.

Examples

merge/dev_lombok-refactoring

merge/combined-device-support

## PostgreSQL Naming Conventions

Use clear, descriptive names. Use camelCase for multi-word names. Avoid using PostgreSQL reserved words.

## RESTful API Design Rules

### URI Design Rules

* **Use nouns, not verbs**: URIs should represent resources (e.g., /users, /orders), not actions.
* **Use plural nouns for collections**: /users instead of /user.
* **Use hierarchical structure for relationships**: /users/{id}/orders instead of deep nesting.
* **Avoid deep nesting**: Limit to 2-3 levels (e.g., /users/{id}/orders, not /users/{id}/orders/{orderId}/items/{itemId}).
* **Use query parameters for filtering**: /orders?status=pending instead of /orders/pending.

### HTTP Methods & Status Codes

Use standard HTTP methods:

* **GET** → Retrieve data
* **POST** → Create new resources
* **PUT** → Replace entire resource
* **PATCH** → Update part of a resource
* **DELETE** → Remove a resource

Use appropriate HTTP status codes:

* **200 OK** → Successful retrieval or update
* **201 Created** → Resource successfully created
* **204 No Content** → Successful delete/update with no return body
* **400 Bad Request** → Invalid request
* **401 Unauthorized** → Authentication required
* **403 Forbidden** → No permission
* **404 Not Found** → Resource doesn’t exist
* **500 Internal Server Error** → Unexpected error

### Hypermedia & Response Structure

* Use HATEOAS (Hypermedia links for better navigation).
* Return created resources with POST (or provide Location header).
* Use consistent response formats (JSON).

### Pagination & Filtering

* Paginate large responses:

  * Use limit and offset (GET /users?limit=20&offset=40).

* Response should include metadata:

```json
{
  "total": 1000,
  "page": 3,
  "per_page": 20,
  "users": [ ... ]
}
```

* Use query parameters for filtering:

```plaintext
/orders?status=shipped&date=2024-02-05
```

### API Versioning

Version APIs to avoid breaking changes:

* **Use URL versioning**: /v1/users
* **Or use header versioning**: Accept: application/vnd.myapi.v1+json

### Security & Authentication

* Use HTTPS for all API requests.
* Require authentication for sensitive data (JWT, OAuth, API Keys).
* Use 403 Forbidden for unauthorized access attempts.

## Visual Studio Extensions

* Prettier
* ESLint
* SonarLint
* Code Spell Checker
